Hi

This is a simple project that I am looking to make

This project is designed where you can run an installer, and then run a loader which would automatically detect and run a dedicated handler, which would be capable of allowing you to manage multiple reactors as well as turbines, 5 reactors which could be producing a mix of steam for your turbines or just outright producing energy for the base

Requirements:
Advanced Computer - 1 for up to 5 reactors or 20 turbines;
Advanced monitor - 3 blocks tall and 4 blocks wide;
Modem network - aiming to allow Lua to detect the computer ports for both turbines and reactors as BigReactors-<type>_<ID>

Aims:
The aim is for this project is so that this project can detect reactors and turbines while posting overall stats, allowing you to controll them globally with a delay of 1 second(default) among each machine connected to each handler

Features:
None yet as this project is still in the works, but if you have any features you wish to implement or improve please create a fork if you wish for others to be capable of accessing these
